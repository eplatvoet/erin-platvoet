# Erin Platvoet Laravel Portfolio

## Description
This is the *Laravel* portfolio of Erin Platvoet.

The 'Home' page (landing page) is essentially a single page portfolio, however, there is definitely opportunity to expand this site to more pages. (i.e., '/erin' dives into some personal interests outside of web development!)

## Installation
To ensure proper local build, please make sure you are at the following versions:

- Node: *v12.18.3*
- PHP: *7.3*

1. Create `.env` file based off example
2. Run `npm install` out of directory
3. Once `npm install` complete, run `composer install`
4. Once `composer install` complete, run `php artisan key:generate`
    - You should now see the `APP_KEY` field populated in your `.env` file
5. Run `npm run dev`
6. Go to 'public' folder & open new terminal and run `php -S localhost:8000`
    - *Please note: you don't necessarily have to use 8000*

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
